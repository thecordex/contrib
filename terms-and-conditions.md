CONTRIBUTING TERMS & CONDITIONS
-------------------------------

**Version:** `0.1.0`

Contributing to the *TheCordex* project means you have read, acknowledge,
and agree to the following terms and conditions.

- I. Contributions are done so willingly by the contributor for the sole
intent of contributing to this non-profit project and do so with no
expectation of compensation.

- II. Contributions are hereby in possession of the project and therefore are
property of the project itself. The project’s current lead has claim
over all contributions for the project, not for use outside of the
project. In the event of the project’s end of lifetime, then reusable
contributions may be released to the contributor(s) or to the person(s)
with explicit permission from ALL contributors of the contribution.

- III. Whilst the project remains non-profit, no profit may be gained from any
contributions.

- IV. All contributors and notable work must be accredited to said
contributors. No sole contributor of a collaborative work may claim
ownership over a contribution (regardless of if the project is still
active) unless they have received explicit permission from ALL other
contributors.

- V. Copyrighted material or unauthorized use of third-party material may not
be used in the project, no exceptions. If in the case of this happening,
it is by the person(s) involved who approved the material and not of the
project as a whole.

- VI. If you wish to release content contributed to the project, it must be
approved by the current project lead. If the content is released without
approval then the content is subject to be removed without warning from
the *TheCordex* project.

- VII. Requests for content take-down may be respected depending on a
per-situation basis, although the project is under no obligation to take
down any willingly contributed work and may rightfully refuse to comply
(see section II).

- VIII. These terms & conditions may change with or without notice to
current and past contributors. It is up to the contributor to stay
up-to-date and informed on the current terms & conditions.

*Note: Contributors are not constrained to simply contributing solely to
the **TheCordex** project. Although it should be noted that projects of
similar direction and concept should be dealt with delicately.*
